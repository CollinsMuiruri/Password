#PASSWORD is a project where the user's credentials of various accounts that the user has logged into are stored.

#The user can retrieve the information once he/she has signed up.

#The app can also generate a random password for the user.

#One can navigate through the app via specified commands.

#                    .USING.
I created this project using python 3.6 and only works while opened in the terminal.

 To acquire the app just open my files in a text editor and run them in a python shell in the terminal.
For this, just clone the work from https://github.com/CollinsMuiruri/Password or extract the files from the downloaded zip file.

Then open the python shell using the user.py file:
                 python3.6 user.py

#                    .REQUIREMENTS.
#You will need python 3.6 for the app to work.
